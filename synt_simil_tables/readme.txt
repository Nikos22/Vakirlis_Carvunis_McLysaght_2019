These tables contain the micro-synteny conservation and sequence similarity information 
(at the phylostratigraphy  optimal E-value cut-off) of every focal gene in the three datasets
relative to every target genome. 

The additional Gene_ID column contains gene IDs from ENSEMBL for human, 
gene IDs from FlyBase for fruitfly and protein IDs from NCBI for yeast. 

They are used to generate Figure 4B and C and Supp. Figure 6 .
